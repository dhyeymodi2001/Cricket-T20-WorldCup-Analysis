The Cricket T20 World Cup Data Analytics project focuses on analyzing data from the 2022 T20 World Cup to uncover insights and trends in player and team performances. I independently designed and implemented this data-driven project to evaluate match statistics and determine the optimal playing XI based on performance metrics.

> To interact with the dashboard you can download the pbix file from the repository and open it in Power BI Desktop locally.

## Process & Methodology:
- **Data Collection:** Used web scraping techniques via BrightData to extract comprehensive statistics from the ESPN Cricinfo website. This included data on player performances, match results, and other key game metrics.(http://www.espn.in/cricket/)
 - **Data Cleaning & Transformation:*** Processed and cleaned the raw data using Python and Pandas to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and optimize data for analysis. The data was then transformed into a usable format to extract key insights.
- **Data Modeling & Analysis:** Imported the cleaned data into Power BI for further analysis. Developed DAX-based models to calculate and compare various performance indicators such as runs, wickets, economy rates, and strike rates. These models allowed for a dynamic evaluation of players and teams.
- **Dashboard Development:** Created visually compelling and interactive dashboards in Power BI to illustrate trends, patterns, and player comparisons. These dashboards provided a comprehensive view of the tournament and helped identify the most impactful players across different scenarios.

## Key Insights Derived:
- Identification of top-performing players based on various performance metrics (batting, bowling, and all-rounder roles).
- Insights into team strategies, including powerplay efficiency, middle-overs control, and death-overs impact.
- A data-driven approach to selecting the best playing XI for any given match based on the analysis of performance indicators.

## Technologies Used:
- **BrightData** (Web Scraping)
- **Python** (Pandas for Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & DAX for Data Modeling)
- **DAX** (Data Modeling and Advanced Calculations)
